              William Shakespeare (bapt. 26 April[b] 1564 â€“ 23 April 1616)[c]
              was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded
              as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's
              pre-eminent dramatist.[2][3][4] He is often called England's
              national poet and the "Bard of Avon" (or simply "the Bard").[5][d]
              His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39
              plays,[e] 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other
              verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been
              translated into every major living language and are performed more
              often than those of any other playwright.[7] He remains arguably
              the most influential writer in the English language, and his works
              continue to be studied and reinterpreted.
